DEFINITION[SUBTITLE]		= "Cancer occurs when cells in our body turn abnormal and start to grow out of control. In breast cancer, these abnormal cells grow in the breast to become a lump.

TREATMENT[LUMPECTOMY_P3]		= "After a surgery, a drain is used to remove any fluid or blood that collects under the wound. This drain consists of a soft plastic tube connected to a plastic bottle. It will be removed once there is no more fluid or blood."
